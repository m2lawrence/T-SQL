I built this test text file using VIM editor in MinTTy cmd line tool. Code shown below in GitBash programme for GitHub.

The three steps to build programmes and then put them onto here is:
Add, Commit, Push.



My code:

m2law@MikesHP-321191 MINGW64 ~/desktop/t-sql (master)
$ git add .
warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in testfile.txt.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.

m2law@MikesHP-321191 MINGW64 ~/desktop/t-sql (master)
$ git commit -m "test for mike"
[master (root-commit) 699999c] test for mike
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 testfile.txt

m2law@MikesHP-321191 MINGW64 ~/desktop/t-sql (master)
$ git status
